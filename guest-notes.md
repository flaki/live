##Pre-requisites

Each episode, our podcast guests can join us live from anywhere!

Ensure you have the following:

1. A quiet location, away from the window so we don't capture too much ambient noise
1. Good Internet (Wired or strong WiFi)
1. Laptop
1. Headphone connected to your laptop
1. Microphone connected to your laptop
1. Download [Mumble](http://mumble.sourceforge.net/#Get_Mumble) for Windows / Linux / Mac OSX

The next steps will take you **just 3 minutes** and you will be able to join the live podcast server. We have MAC OSX screenshots along with Windows where it differs. Try it out :)

##Basics

##Live podcast server

- Open the server connection dialog

![Server connection dialog]({{ site.url}}/img/guest-notes-8.jpg)

- <a name="password"></a>Connect with the following info:
    1. Username: Put your name and not "guest-name"
    2. Password: You should already have the password.

![Add server]({{ site.url}}/img/guest-notes-9.jpg)

- <a name="click"></a>**Important:** <span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Double click the chat room name "webuildsg-live"</strong></span> to join. Otherwise, you will be just in the lobby and not inside the chat room to hear the sound board and the hosts during the live show.

![Double click the chat room]({{ site.url}}/img/guest-notes-11.jpg)

- Yay!! We will do the same process, but just one hour before the live show with hosts and the sound board.

![Chat room]({{ site.url}}/img/guest-notes-12.jpg)

- This is how the mumble interface will typically look during the live show.

- Take note of the chat inside the interface that you can use to communicate with only the hosts during the show

![Mumble Chat]({{ site.url}}/img/guest-notes-14.jpg)

- While typing in the chat there will be notification sounds. You can switch them off by going to Preferences > Messages tab > uncheck all columns expect for 1st column "Console"

##Audio preferences

- Open `Menu > Mumble > Preferences`
- Check the "Advanced" options right at the top

![Mumble preferences]({{ site.url}}/img/guest-notes-10.jpg)

- **Important:** You must click "Apply" and save the settings. Close this preference menu before you can hear the audio.

**For Windows**: Go to Configure > Settings.

![Mumble Settings on Windows]({{ site.url}}/img/guest-notes-10a-win.jpg)

Ensure that you check the "Advanced" options.

##(Optional) Chat with live audience

- Join the chat with our live audience at **irc.freenode.net** in the channel **#webuildsg**
- If you do not have an external IRC client, join the web client via [Scrollback.io](https://scrollback.io/webuildsg)
- During the live show, close this website [live.webuild.sg](http://live.webuild.sg) so that you do not hear yourself through the live streaming audio

##We'll have a [final check](/checklist#final) for 10 minutes at 10am, 1 hour before we go live! It'll be fun :)
