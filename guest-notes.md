Firstly, let's configure your audio with [mumble](http://mumble.sourceforge.net/#Get_Mumble):

- Open [mumble](http://mumble.sourceforge.net/#Get_Mumble)

Finally, let's connect to the live podcast server!

- Open the server connection dialog

![Server connection dialog]({{ site.url}}/img/guest-notes-8.jpg)

- <a name="password"></a>Connect with the following info:
    1. Username: Put your name and not "guest-name"
    2. Password: You should already have the password.

![Add server]({{ site.url}}/img/guest-notes-9.jpg)

- <a name="click"></a>**Important:** <span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Double click the chat room name "webuildsg-live"</strong></span> to join. Otherwise, you will be just in the lobby and not inside the chat room to hear the sound board and the hosts during the live show.

![Double click the chat room]({{ site.url}}/img/guest-notes-11.jpg)

- Yay!! We will do the same process, but just one hour before the live show with hosts and the sound board.

- This is how the mumble interface will typically look during the live show.
