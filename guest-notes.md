Each episode, our podcast guests can join us live from anywhere!

Ensure you have the following:

- Laptop
- Headphone connected to your laptop
- Microphone connected to your laptop
- Download [mumble](http://mumble.sourceforge.net/#Get_Mumble)

You can join our conversation from your own home or any other **quiet location** with **good Internet**. If you have access to Wired Internet, it's better than using WiFi. Otherwise ensure you get a strong WiFi signal where you're recording from. Also try to find a location which is relatively quiet and not near a window so we don't capture too much ambient noise.

The next steps will take you **just 3 minutes** and you will be able to join the live podcast server. We have MAC OSX screenshots along with Windows where it differs. Try it out :)

Firstly, let's configure your audio with [mumble](http://mumble.sourceforge.net/#Get_Mumble):

- Open [mumble](http://mumble.sourceforge.net/#Get_Mumble)
- Open Menu > Configure > Audio Wizard
- Audio Tuning Wizard's Introduction page will first appear

![Audio Tuning Wizard]({{ site.url }}/img/guest-notes-2.jpg)

**For Windows**: Configure > Audio Wizard

![Audio Tuning Wizard Windows]({{ site.url }}/img/guest-notes-2-win.jpg)

- Choose your input and output devices. Choose your Audio I/O interface or USB microphone if you're using one. If you're using a the microphone jack of your computer, leave it as Default.

- Listen through your headphone and change the slider accordingly.

Next, let's meddle with [mumble](http://mumble.sourceforge.net/#Get_Mumble) preferences:

- Open [mumble](http://mumble.sourceforge.net/#Get_Mumble)
- Open Menu > Mumble > Preferences
- Check the "Advanced" options right at the top

![Mumble preferences]({{ site.url}}/img/guest-notes-10.jpg)

- **Important:** You must click "Apply" and save the settings. Close this preference menu before you can hear the audio.

**For Windows**: Go to Configure > Settings.

![Mumble Settings on Windows]({{ site.url}}/img/guest-notes-10a-win.jpg)

Ensure that you check the "Advanced" options.

Finally, let's connect to the live podcast server!

- Open the server connection dialog

![Server connection dialog]({{ site.url}}/img/guest-notes-8.jpg)

- <a name="password"></a>Connect with the following info:
    1. Username: Put your name and not "guest-name"
    2. Password: You should already have the password.

![Add server]({{ site.url}}/img/guest-notes-9.jpg)

- <a name="click"></a>**Important:** <span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Double click the chat room name "webuildsg-live"</strong></span> to join. Otherwise, you will be just in the lobby and not inside the chat room to hear the sound board and the hosts during the live show.

![Double click the chat room]({{ site.url}}/img/guest-notes-11.jpg)

- Yay!! We will do the same process, but just one hour before the live show with hosts and the sound board.

![Chat room]({{ site.url}}/img/guest-notes-12.jpg)

- This is how the mumble interface will typically look during the live show.

![During the live show]({{ site.url}}/img/guest-notes-13.jpg)

- Take note of the chat inside the interface that you can use to communicate with only the hosts during the show

![Mumble Chat]({{ site.url}}/img/guest-notes-14.jpg)

- While typing in the chat there will be notification sounds. You can switch them off by going to Preferences > Messages tab > uncheck all columns expect for 1st column "Console"

![Notification sounds off]({{ site.url}}/img/guest-notes-15.jpg)

* * *

- Join the chat with our live audience at **irc.freenode.net** in the channel **#webuildsg**
- If you do not have an external IRC client, join the web client via [Scrollback.io](https://scrollback.io/webuildsg)
- During the live show, close this website [live.webuild.sg](http://live.webuild.sg) so that you do not hear yourself through the live streaming audio

##There'll be a [final check](/checklist#final) for 10 minutes at 10am, 1 hour before we go live! It'll be fun :)
